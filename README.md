# Project: Recipe-library

The assignment was to create a recipe library with different filter and sorting functions.

# The problem

We applied concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, function definitions, conditional statements, variable assignment, and object and array manipulation. We styled it to look like a given design using CSS.
If we had more time we would have added more filters and sorting functions.
