# Virtual Book Library

The assignment for this project was to build a digital book library that will load and display information such as title, year, author and description of each book. Furthermore, the user should be able to filter the books by genre or sorting them by year or rate.

## The problem

I approached this project step by step by using the comments to guide me.
If I had more time I would have created a function that would have made it possible for the user to sort the books by the current filter and maintain the filter even after sorting.
It was also a bit tricky to make the images in the library the same hight, but I learned that setting the height property and using object-fit: cover; for the images helps maintain consistent image dimensions and cropping when necessary.
