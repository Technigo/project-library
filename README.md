Hello World - destination library
The assignment was to create a library website with javascript, using arrays and object that we filter, sort and search within based on name etc and a random selection. We chose to work with the theme travel destinations.

We worked in a team of two, consisting of:
Sofie Ferrari Strahl and Izabel Lind FÃ¤rnstrand

The problem
We bumped into some problems with the sorting and approached this by googling, experimenting, discussing and reviewing exsisting code online. We started the project by doing a figma with a design and planned different goals. If we had more time we would have added a favorites function and added more destinations and a filter for accessibility.
