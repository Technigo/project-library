# project-library

We had the assignment to do a library. We decided to go with the books and do an online library for it. We should be able to display all the books and have an option to filter them and sort them. There should also be a button to select a random book.

## the problem

We started by adding a basic HTML setup to see how the elements look like and then style everything in CSS. After that we went to the JS File and started doing to functions needed for displaying the books according to the selected filter or sorting. In the end we added a search button.
