# project-library

Made a library who displays all of the elements (and their information) in the chosen array when the website is loaded
Made several filters
added sorting 
added search
added random 

did not have time to sort the filtered elements, or style the site properly 
had some issues with prettier and template strings who led to a whole lot more work on each save.
