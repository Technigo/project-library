In this pocket bookshop website, users can

* Filter books by genre and publication year.
* Sort books by various criteria such as rating, publication year, author, and title.
* View a random book from the collection.

## The problem

I found it challenging to ensure that the filters and sorting interacted smoothly with each other.

I managed to apply sorting smoothly to different genre filters and year filters. However, I'm still searching a good solution to find intersections when applying multiple filters simultaneously.

## Next step

* Search a good solution to find intersections when applying multiple filters simultaneously.
  
* More styling

* Make a search bar


## View it live
