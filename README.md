# project-library

We created a library of recipes. There are filters, sorting and a random button to use.

# The problem

We had some issues with creating the filters and the sorting but there was just small parts missing. We researched on google and found out how to do it. We did a plan in Figma before starting to code with the layout of how we wanted to have the site. If we had more time we would add more ways to sort, like sorting after amount of ingredients.
