# Build a Digital library

This week's project is to build a website where you can order food by clicking through a number of choices. If the order goes well, the procedure ends with the user confirming or canceling the order.
This week's exciting project is to build a digital library, using an array of books.

## The problem

DOM manipulation has been used to create and modify elements on the web page. Data comes from an array of books.
In order to be able to filter the books by genre, an event listener is used on a drop-down list. When the user selects a genre, a filter function creates a new array containing only the books that match the selected genre.
