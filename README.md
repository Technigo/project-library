# Project Library
This week, we had a to build a library that fetched objects from an array and visualized them in a library. You should add some kind of filtering, sorting selections, a randomizer button and a search function.

## The problem
The project was inititally meant to be a pair project, but since my partner got sick before we could start, I decided to do this project on my own since all other pairs had already started with theirs. It turned out good though, since I got to test a bunch of stuff myself and tweak the designs a lot, which I love to do, but usually takes me a couple of hours of hyper focusing, which I sometimes feel like I have to set aside in group projects to not waste anybody else's time. So this all turned out pretty great for me I think.
