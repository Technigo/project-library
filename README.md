#Project: Martin and Mai's Recipe book
This project involves building a responsibe web page that displays elements from a provied dataset (recipes) upon loading. Users can interact through features such as filtering, sorting, select recipes from random, search and so on. 

#How we solved the problem
Divided and conquered. We worked on different functions and then merged them. We established our plan using a Figjam sketch.
