# project-library
This week we were to create a library with arrays and objects and create functions to filter/sort the library items.


Project Library

# The problem
I had a hard time with this project due to being sick all week and had to catch up the week after. I got alot of help from the Q&A recorded session and the student example to be able to understand the project. The most difficult part was that I didnt get the book cards to show on my webpage, it was completely blank after writing my first function but with the help from my teammates I figured it out that I had to call on the function for them to show on the webpage.
