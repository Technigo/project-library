# Project Name
Project-Library. People can search books' information by different catagory, such as genre, publish time. 

# The problem
To display objects on webpage was hard to me at the beginning. I was confused and it took me a while to understand. 
When I made the display of random book I met problems. In the end I found out, I should've set a new array because the random method is an object not an array. 
It was a great chance to practice CSS again.
