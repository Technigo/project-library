# Recipe Library

In this project we built a recipe library where you can filter on cuisine type, sort by cooking time and search for recipes by keyword. We further practiced the concepts introduced last week like DOM manipulation, functions and event listeners, as well as new concepts like objects and for each loops.

# The problem

We approached the problem by first writing the basic HTML code needed - buttons and filter dropdown. Then we made sure the filtering and sorting worked before we went on to style the site.

We struggled a lot with making the filtering work. We finally realized that it didn't work because we were rendering all recipe cards again after the filtering function. Another issue we had was that the sorting didn't work when we tried to copy the code from class. We needed to use the parseInt method since we were comparing numbers (time) rather than alphabetical order. Once these two issues were solved, the rest went pretty smoothly. We are pretty heppy with the result but if we would have had more time, we would probably have worked more on the styling.
