# project-library

For this weeks project I wanted to challenge myself by trying to recreate the layout of the Figma template. Styling, for example fonts are differing but other than that the layout is similar. This was an opportunity to prepare for future projects where I may need to bring a client's design preferences to life. 

## The problem

The logic for the buttons were my biggest issue, the filtering, sorting and randomizing. It took some time to find the code that worked to some extent. I compared other peoples project solutions for the buttons and changed it to work for my webpage.

If I had more time I would work more on the functions of the buttons, specifically ascending and descending. If you click on one of them they will stay active. You are still able to click on the other buttons but it would be nice to clear it. Also had an idea with the "Show more"-button to make the container longer so that you could see more of the recipe and the hover were going to get you to the website of the recipe when clicked. Now the "Show more"-button takes you to the webpage when clicked. Probably would have tried to make some other approach there. Would have also wanted to add a search bar somewhere on the webpage.
