# Book Library
For this week's project we have created a library of books using arrays and objects. You can sort books alphabetically on our website, choose a random book using the shuffle button, and sort by genre and year/century.

## The problem
We started by sketching it out on figma. Then we did a basic HTML file and some very basic CSS. Then we started working on the JS file. First we created the container that shows all the books, then we added a filter by genre and an option to sort alphabetically. After that we created the random book option and another filter sorting by year/century. To complete the project, we added the final styling.  

Working with pair programming and also asynchronous on this one.
