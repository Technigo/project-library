# project-library
We have created a website to search, filter and sort books.

The assignment was to use JavaScript functions for user to filter, sort and search.

# The problem
We had the problem to reset after sort. So all other filters were based on the sorting result. But in the end we figured it out and leart the difference between sort() and toSorted().

After the sort function can be reseted, we would like to sort after the filter result. But the time is tight so the two functions cannot interact with each other. It will be done in the future.
