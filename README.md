In this pocket bookshop website, users can

* Filter books by genre and publication year.
* Sort books by various criteria such as rating, publication year, author, and title.
* View a random book from the collection.

## The problem

* I found it challenging to ensure that the filters and sorting interacted smoothly with each other.

ðŸ˜„ I managed to apply sorting smoothly to different genre filters and year filters. 
ðŸ¤” However, I'm still searching a good solution to find intersections when applying multiple filters simultaneously. Right now the code is not that clear.

* I also struggled with maintaining the hover effect on the book cards after updating the book display. The event listeners were lost in the process.
  
ðŸ˜„ After some research I discovered about the concept of "event delegation". It's very enlightening!

## Next step

* Make the code drier for applying multiple filters simultaneously.
  
* More styling

* Make a search bar


## View it live
