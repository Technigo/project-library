Project-library
This project is about building a digital library using an array of books, where you can sort the books, use a filter or a button to generate a random book.

The problem
We started with the basic HTML we needed and then went over to the JavaScript. We had some trouble to get it to work and after seeing some examples 
it got more clear but it still didn't work. We approached the problem through trial and error and finally it worked.
