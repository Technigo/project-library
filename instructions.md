# Instructions about the project

## Navigating this repository

We have provided a starter kit for your project in the GitHub repo. It includes an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JS file. Don't forget to connect the files.

### index.html

Here you will create some HTML elements. Don't forget to add IDs to the elements so you can access and update them later in the JavaScript file.

### script.js

In order to simplify the execution of this project, we have provided you with two arrays with data. **Remove the one you are not using (or both if you create your own)**.

## How to get started

## Requirements

- Your page should display all of the elements (and their information) in the chosen array when the website is loaded ✅
- Your page should have at least one `filter`, e.g. on genre or cuisine type
- Your page should be able to `sort` on at least one property, e.g.: ✅
  - _for books_:
    - from newest to oldest and vice versa ✅
    - from the highest to lowest rating and vice versa ✅
- Your page should feature a button that selects a random book, and your page should display the selected item ✅

## Stretch Goals

So you’ve completed all the steps above? Great job! Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting on the stretch goals. Remember that the stretch goals are optional.

### Intermediate stretch goals

- Go wild with the filtering. Add a filter to:
  - only show the books from the 21st century
- Go wild with the sorting. Sort on:
  - Alphabetical order ✅

### Advanced stretch goals

- Create a search bar where the user can search for specific keywords
- Recreate the same design as the one provided in the example on Figma ✅
